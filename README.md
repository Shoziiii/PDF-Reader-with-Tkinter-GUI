# PDF-Reader-with-Tkinter-GUI
Looking for a PDF Reader!!!

I have made a simple GUI using Tkinter using PyPDF2 and pyttsx3.
The GUI allows you to upload any PDF from your System, also allows
you to select the page number and it will start reading from there.

Hope you like this little project of mine.
Thanks
